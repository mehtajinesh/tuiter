        create the Home screen for users to view tuit posts and create new posts as shown down below. Like most screens, add a Back link to navigate back to the previous screen, navigation.html in this case. Below the link add an h1 Tuiter header and an h2 Home header below that. Below the headers add a 48 by 48 pixel image representing the owner of the account. Use an image of your choice. Add a textarea element for users to post new tuits. The textarea should have a placeholder that says "What's happening?". Add a dropdown with options "Everyone can reply", "People you follow", and "Only people you mention", with values "EVERYONE", "FOLLOWING", and "MENTIONED" respectively. Default value should be "EVERYONE". Add a button to upload an image and another button labeled "Tuit" to create a new tuit.
    
        Use an unordered list ul to create a couple of tuits as line item elements li as bullet points. As the header of the tuit, add a hyperlink referencing topic.html labeled Topic 123. Add a 48 by 48 pixel image, a link referencing profile.html labeled Alice, add a handle @alice, and a time stamp of 2 hours as shown on the right. Below the tuit's header add a paragraph with dummy content as shown. Below the tuit, add Reply, Retuit, Like, and Share links linked to reply.html, retuit.html, like.html, and share.html respectively. Include count values 123, 234, and 345.
